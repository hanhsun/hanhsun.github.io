Experienced aerospace engineer and manager focused on commercial space system V\&V. My technical areas of interest are flight software test and development, linear and nonlinear system identification, control theory, and dynamic modeling and simulation. I am experienced in configuration management and collaboration tools such as Git and JIRA, and also a strong believer of Agile SW development.

 I had my first M.S. in Engineering Science working with [Dr. Jer-Nan Juang](http://dnc.tamu.edu/projects/students/juang.html) at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan. During my MS. I was mostly at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) Structural Dynamics Branch and I fell in love with aerospace research. I decided to pursue a second MS. degree at Texas A&M.
