Currently an Aerospace Engineering M.S. student working under [Dr. John Valasek](https://vscl.tamu.edu/people/john-valasek/) at the [Texas A&M Vehicle Systems and Control Laboratory](https://vscl.tamu.edu/). I have my first M.S. in Engineering Science working with [Dr. Jer-Nan Juang](http://dnc.tamu.edu/projects/students/juang.html) at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan. During my MS. I was mostly at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) Structural Dynamics Branch and I fell in love with aerospace research. I decided to pursue a second MS. degree at Texas A&M. My primary technical areas of interest are linear and nonlinear system identification, control theory, dynamical modeling and simulation. He is currently heavily involved in UAV flight operations including mission planning, flight simulation, embedded systems development, mission ground control and UAV vehicle development.

## Education
* **Master of Science** Texas A & M University, Aerospace Engineering
* **Master of Science** National Cheng Kung University, Engineering Science

## Skills
* Proficient in **MATLAB / Simulink** through nonlinear dynamical simulations for both spacecraft and air vehicles.
* Proficient in **Python** for mathematical estimation, microcontroller development, multiagent communication, and
implementation of estimation and control algorithms through thesis research.
* Strong knowledge of **C/C++** developed through the implementation of real-time robotics and communication
(UDP/TCP protocols). Embedded systems development experience such as Arduino, BeagleBone Black, and
Raspberry Pi.

* Advanced knowledge of **UNIX** shell scripting.
* Project experience of **HTML5**, **CSS**, **Python**, and **Javascript** for webpage design.
