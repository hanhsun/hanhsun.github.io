## In a Nutshell
This was a joint project with Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI) trying to demonstrate the capabilities of fixed-wing and rotor-craft SUAS for bridge, oil well, and railway vegetation encroachment. Several SUAS (UAS under 50 lbs) were tested by carrying RGB, infrared, and multi-spectral sensors. A two man operation was performed to show that by applying the operation procedures, infrastructural assessment tasks requiring high resolution imageries can be achieved.

## Introduction
Periodic inspection and assessment of roads, railroads, pipelines, bridges, etc., is currently a costly and time-consuming endeavor. It in many cases requires large teams of trained workers operating specialized machinery that is costly to set up and operate. UAS have been shown to be useful tools providing high performance and cost-effective solutions in a diverse range of areas. A 2012 survey of UAS applications found UAS to be reliable platforms for research and civil missions.

## Key Challenges
* Establish and demonstrate procedures with selected flight hardware that enable a small team to quickly perform infrastructure assessment tasks using UAS.
* Provide high resolution multi-spectral imagery.
