This was a seminar talk I presented at an invited session at [Texas A&M GEOSAT](https://geosat.tamu.edu/). In the one hour talk, I talked about the past, current, and future of conducting earth science related research using the power of UAVs. [Here's](https://geosat.tamu.edu/2017/11/02/seminar-recap-jack-lu-shows-us-that-mapping-crop-development-with-multiple-simultaneously-running-autonomous-vehicles-is-no-easy-feat/) the public release on talk if you're interested in it.

    <div class="toright">
        <p>Currently, precision agricultural and geo-spatial research using UAVs are inefficient and often unreliable. Data are collected on the vehicle at the test site and then downloaded to a storage device.

        The data is then analyzed and mosaiced at a supercomputer. Returning results time can vary from days to weeks.</p>

        Issues include:
        <ul>
            <li>Sensors not properly integrated with flight plan, vehicle, and environmental conditions (wind, lighting...etc)</li>
            <li>Data analysis conducted post flight</li>
            <li>Large data number without proper data reduction results in mosaic tragedy</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

The scientific results were promosing, and the results from my group's previous work that were published are listed:
- [Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for High-Throughput Phenotyping and Agronomic Research-2016](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159781)
- [Multispectral and DSLR sensors for assessing crop stress in corn and cotton using fixed-wing unmanned air systems-2016](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/9866/1/Multispectral-and-DSLR-sensors-for-assessing-crop-stress-in-corn/10.1117/12.2228894.short?SSO=1)
- [Development and testing of a customized low-cost unmanned aircraft system based on multispectral and thermal sensing for precision agriculture applications-2017](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7991494/)

## Challenges
From my past experience, with our current system Precision Agriculture using UAS as an aiding tool is indeed **feasible**, however in order to enhance the capabilities, the following challenges needs to be addressed:

- **Reduced data analysis time** on image quality.
- Real time environmental feedback to incorporate wind and lighting issues during flight.
- Closing the loop on image analysis for possible mission adjustments in-flight.
