## In a Nutshell
The overall goal of this project is to generate data necessary for effective utilization of UAS-based imaging techniques for crop production and weed management applications. UAS can be equipped to include multi-spectral sensors (3 to 4 bands in the visible and near-infrared/NIR range), hyperspectral sensors (Headwallâ€™s Standard Micro-Hyperspec VNIR 380-1000 nm spectral range), thermal sensors and LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), among others. These sensors have a multitude of applications, in areas such as soil, crop, water and weed management in agriculture.

## Key Challenges
* Imaging mission planning incorporating sensor settings
* Quantification of the growth and development of field crops as affected by soil, irrigation and crop management strategies
* Increasing **reliability** of the collected image quality through image pre-processing and image post processing

## More Info
More information on the system I developed can be found in my [Development and testing of a customized low-cost unmanned aircraft system based on multispectral and thermal sensing for precision agriculture applications-2017](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7991494/) paper.
